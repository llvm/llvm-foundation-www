Please have a look to see if you know any of them and could help with reaching

<a href=https://goo.gl/forms/X4HiyYRcRHOnTSvC3>this web
form</a>. Part of that form will prompt
them with a DocuSign agreement that they can sign online to cover anything they
personally contributed. The web form will also collect any companies or academic
institutions that may own rights to some of their contributions so that we can
cover them with the corporate agreement below.
If for any reason they cannot sign the DocuSign agreement, we also accept an
email sent to <a href=mailto:license-questions@llvm.org>license-questions@llvm.org</a> in which they explicitly agree to offer
their past contributions to LLVM under the Apache 2.0 WITH LLVM exception
license.</p><p>We do ask that individuals generally sign the individual agreement even if they
think their contributions are covered by a corporate agreement.</p><h2 id=corporations>Corporations</h2><p>When you do reach out to a corporation, please do let us know at
<a href=mailto:license-questions@llvm.org>license-questions@llvm.org</a>. Corporations can sign the agreement to relicense
their contributions to LLVM under the new license
<a href="https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5a2bb38c-41c4-4ce0-a26e-52a7eb8ae51c">with DocuSign</a>.
This is our preferred mechanism for collecting signatures.</p><p>One way to explain briefly what we&rsquo;re asking for to people at corporations who
may not have heard about the LLVM relicensing project yet is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>The LLVM project is deep into a multi-year long project to improve their
source code licensing model, moving from a MIT+BSD-like (“UIUC”) license to
an Apache 2 license. The new license went into effect in Jan 2019, and the
project is looking to get permission from contributors to move their pre-2019
contributions to the new licensing model (more info here:
<a href=https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/relicensing_long_tail>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/relicensing_long_tail</a> ). Our newer
contributions have all been covered under the new license approach.</p><p>Can we/you sign the docusign form at
<a href="https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5a2bb38c-41c4-4ce0-a26e-52a7eb8ae51c">https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5a2bb38c-41c4-4ce0-a26e-52a7eb8ae51c</a>
to give this permission?</p></blockquote><p>If you have any questions, remarks or suggestions, please contact us at
