In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the Board for productive discussion and vote. Board members are expected to monitor the board mail lists to address time critical issues or continue discussions between board meetings. Board members should plan on attending at least EuroLLVM or the US LLVM Developers\u0026rsquo; Meeting. In addition to the regular meeting, board members are expected to participate with and drive efforts aligned with the mission and three programs above. Officers of the Board (Secretary, Treasurer, President) have additional duties and time commitments.\nThe current 2020-2022 LLVM Foundation Board of Directors:\n Kit Barton Kristof Beyls Mike Edwards (Treasurer) Hal Finkel Cyndy Ishida Anton Korobeynikov Tanya Lattner (President) Chris Lattner Tom Stellard (Secretary)  "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/branch-rename/','title':"Branch Renaming",'content':"Renaming Default Branch to \u0026lsquo;Main\u0026rsquo; Many tech communities, including GitHub and Git, have moved away from the term “master branch” and replaced it with “main branch” in an effort to remove unnecessary references to slavery and use more inclusive terms. This was also discussed on the LLVM-dev mailing list and there was strong consensus from LLVM Developers’ that the LLVM Project should also rename our master branch as well. Now that an industry standard name has been selected by GitHub, the LLVM Project can begin the renaming process of the default branch to “main”.\nThis change will occur at 06:00GMT on Monday, December 7, 2020 (time is GMT, please adjust for your local timezone).\nTo make this as easy as possible we plan to do the following prior to November 20, 2020:\n Create a new branch named \u0026lsquo;test-main\u0026rsquo; on the llvm-project repository  This branch will be read-only except for the LLVMBOT account Set up a GitHub action to mirror commits from \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; to ‘test-main\u0026rsquo; automatically Allow the configuration to soak for a few days to ensure everything works   Create a new branch named “main” on the llvm-project repository  This branch will be readonly initially Reuse the previous Github Action to mirror master to main This configuration will stay in place until cut over takes place on Dec. 7    On December 7, 2020:\n We will lock the master branch and change it to be readonly (except the llvmbot account) Switch the GitHub action to mirror commits from the new main branch back to the old master branch Make a few test commits to ensure the GitHub action is functioning as expected Open the main branch to commits from community members In parallel, we will begin to work through the rest of the llvm organization repositories to update branch names as well We will update the developer policy to reflect the change in workflow  On January 28th, 2021:\n We will remove the ‘master’ branch from all repositories in the llvm organization  As we work towards December 7, 2020 we are going to set up a test of this system on a fork of the llvm-project in order to simulate the cut over. If we encounter any issues we will update the community on llvm-dev. We expect the llvm-project repository to be unavailable to developers for approximately 1 hour while the switch is made. Lockout will occur promptly at 06:00GMT on the 7th. Certainly if we finish sooner, we will update llvm-dev to let everyone know the repository is available for use once again.\nInstructions It was noted on the mailing list it might be helpful to include some basic instructions for folks requiring assistance with migrating to the new \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch. Here are two examples of steps one might take to accomplish this task:\nIn my local llvm-project directory:\ngit fetch origin git checkout origin/main -b main  When you are ready to remove your local \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch run:\ngit branch -d master  Here is an alternative approach provided by Mehdi Amini\n# if not already on the master branch git checkout master # Rename the branch locally git branch -m main # Update the tracking so that `git pull`/`git push` lookup the remote main git branch -u origin/main  Status Project status updates and news will be kept up to date and shared on this webpage. Please refer to this page to find the most up to date information.\nAs of 2020.11.12  Following discussion on llvm-dev, we have reached a decision to rename the default branch for llvm-project to \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo;   Thread   Tom Stellard is working through testing the GitHub actions used to keep branches in sync We anticipate having the new \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch created and syncing with \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; by November 20th  As of 2020.12.02  We have completed testing of the use of the llvmbot account to keep test-main branch in sync with the master branch We have dropped the test-main branch and have created the permanent main branch LLVMBOT is now keeping main in sync with master Unless any major issues are encountered in the next few days, we are on track to swap the default branch to main on December 7 as expected  As of 2020.12.07  We have updated the llvm-project repository to use the \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch by default We have corrected issues with the commit mail-list integration The \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch is now in \u0026ldquo;read-only\u0026rdquo; mode and will remain so until January 28th, 2021 We are beginning to work through documentation and other projects in the llvm org to get them updated as well  As of 2021.01.11  We are working through the remaining repositories in the LLVM GitHub organization llvm-lnt \u0026amp; llvm-testsuite were updated to use main today We have sent emails out to other repository owners to enlist their assistance with renaming We still look good to have this effort wrapped up by the 28th of this month  As of 2021.01.28  The removal of the \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branch from all repositories in the LLVM org on GitHub has been completed.

We will improve our setup and work mode as we go along and gain experience.\nScope The working group will work on the LLVM project infrastructure including:\n source code repository bug tracker build servers/machines web sites build system/scripts code review tool mailing lists internet forum chat Documentation of the tools and their work flows.  Working group members The focus of IWG members will be on identifying, designing and agreeing on infrastructure improvements. The implementation of the changes and the operations of our infrastructure can be offloaded to community members or contractors. This way we keep the workload for the working group low.\nWorking group members should have the opportunity to dedicate 4-8 hours per week on a regular basis in the initial phase, as we expect to have a significant pile of decisions to take. It should be less than 4 hours once the roadmap has become more stable.\nWe would like to have broad and diverse community representation within the working group as we are convinced such groups deliver the best results. Please contact us if you want to participate.\nUseful skill to bring to the committee or acquire while working there:\n Managing or hosting software development infrastructure Designing software development workflows and infrastructure Understanding needs of contributors and downstream users IT security and privacy Coordinating work in Open Source Projects Tools and technologies currently used in the Infrastructure (e.g. Mailman, AWS, GCP, Sphinx, GitHub, WWW development, buildbots, Phabricator, \u0026hellip;)  Initial members:\n Christian Kühnel \u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;re recruiting please contact us at iwg@llvm.org!  Proposal for getting started Until we have found a permanent place for our work backlog, Christian created a temporary kanban board so we can track the work.\nProposal for day-to-day work mode This section describes a proposal for the flow for the day to day work of the working group. Note that only the good case is described here. A proposal can be cancelled in any of these steps. There might also be some iterations as some parts of a statement of work (SOW) are not clear or feasible.\n Anyone in the LLVM community (including contractors) can propose a change by creating an issue on the issue tracker. The working group will create a statement of work (SOW) based on the\nproposals they want to move forward on. The SOW will consist of a problem description and (functional and non-functional) requirements for a solution of the problem. The SOW shall be made public and discussed with the community. Once the SOW and it’s costs are clear enough, the working group will decide if and how it shall be implemented (community contribution, paid community bounty, contractor)  If it requires spending money, the working group will propose the change to the board and go through a Request for Proposal process (RFP). The details of that RFP process need to be worked out. The board will then review and approve the expenditure. The Foundation will set up the contract and manage the payments.   The working group will work with the contractor/community on a day-to-day basis to get the work done. The working group will approve the work and authorize payments with the treasurer (if needed).  All of this shall be open and transparent for the community. Feedback from the community is appreciated in all of these steps. In parallel to this, community members are welcome to take over certain SOWs and will get help from the respective contractor if needed. If that work touches shared infrastructure or impacts the future maintenance, the solution needs to be agreed with the working group and the contractor.\nProposal for implementation and operations To keep the workload for the IWG low and scale up the work, the implementation of changes shall be mostly done by a 3rd party.\nOperations of services shall be done by contractors with whom we can have Service Level Agreements (availability, response times, recovery time, handling GDPR requests, \u0026hellip;).\nFor implementing individual changes there are a few options:\n Community volunteers: There is someone from the community willing to implement the change. Community bounty: We\u0026rsquo;re offering a bounty for a community member to implement the change. This is a chance to give back something to community members who are not paid for their contributions by some company or organisation. Contractor: In case something is very large or we can\u0026rsquo;t find anyone to do it the work can be handed off to a contractor.  Ideas for initial work items Until we have a permanent solution for our backlog, Christian started to collect ideas for work items in a list.\nLinks   GitHub project  Discourse category  Discord channel Email address: iwg@llvm.org Original proposal: ( Google Doc, PDF Export)  "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/finance/','title':"Public Documents",'content':"LLVM Foundation Financial Documents This section contains all the Monthly and Annual Financial Reports published by the Foundation.\nMonthly Financial Reports  2020 ...

The high level goals of the relicensing effort are to:\n Encourage ongoing contributions to LLVM by preserving a low barrier to entry for contributors Protect users of LLVM code by providing explicit patent protection in the license Protect contributors to the LLVM project by explicitly scoping their patent contributions with this license Eliminate the schism between runtime libraries and the rest of the compiler that makes it difficult to move code between them Ensure that LLVM runtime libraries may be used by other open source and proprietary compilers  This project involves sensitive legal issues and has been a multi-year effort. The primary public discussions have included these mailing list threads:\n October 19, 2015: Initial license draft proposal September 12, 2016: Second license draft , resolving GPL2 compatibility concerns April 17, 2017: Third license draft , which resolved concern about use of LLVM runtimes with proprietary toolchains August 7, 2017: LLVM Developer Policy wording  Beyond that, these topics have also been discussed by, and include contributions from, over a dozen lawyers and key LLVM contributors, and have been discussed informally with hundreds of people in the LLVM Developer Meeting BoFs.

This is the expected LICENSE.TXT file The revised LLVM developer policy patch  We also have worked with our legal counsel to build several more boring pieces:\n A new top-of-file header block that is minimal and includes the relevant and important information about the new license An individual agreement to relicense and a form to collect information necessary for completing the relicensing A corporate agreement to relicense that is available for companies to sign and has begun to be distributed to some of the known and/or large contributors  The new license was added and changes to the developer policy were completed on January 19, 2019 after the LLVM 8.0 release was branched.\nWe are currently collecting relicensing agreements from copyright holders of contributions before 19th of January 2019. While we already have well over 90% of code covered, we are still working through the long tail. We are seeking volunteers to help us reach individuals and corporations who have not signed the relicense agreements.

Part of that form will prompt them with a DocuSign agreement that they can sign online to cover anything they personally contributed. It will also collect any companies or academic institutions that may own right to some of their contributions so that we can cover them with the corporate agreement below.\nWe do ask that individuals generally sign the individual agreement even if they think their contributions are probably covered by a corporate agreement.\nFeel free to send questions concerns about this to the Foundation mailing list.\nCorporate Relicensing Agreement Corporations may sign an agreement to relicense their contributions to LLVM under the new license with DocuSign . This is our preferred mechanism for collecting signatures. However, if your company requires it, you can print out this PDF of the agreement , sign it, scan it, and send the signed version as a PDF attachment to the LLVM Foundation Board.

The new license went into effect in Jan 2019, and the project is looking to get permission from contributors to move their pre-2019 contributions to the new licensing model (more info here: https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/relicensing_long_tail ).
